# Global Cybersecurity Threats Analysis

This project analyzes global cybersecurity incidents to identify trends, impacts, and patterns over recent years (2015-2024).

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the "Global Cybersecurity" dataset, which includes detailed records of cybersecurity incidents worldwide.

[Kaggle Global Cybersecurity Analysis dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024)

The dataset comprises information such as:
- **Year**: When the incident occurred.
- **Country**: The country affected by the incident.
- **Attack Type**: The method used in the cyber attack (e.g., phishing, DDoS).
- **Sector**: The industry sector targeted (e.g., IT, banking).
- **Financial Loss**: Estimated financial impact of the incident.
- **Number of Affected Users**: Count of individuals affected by the incident.

## Analysis Overview

The project focuses on:

- **Temporal Trends**: Examining how the frequency and severity of cyber attacks have changed over time.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Identifying which countries are most affected by cyber incidents.
- **Attack Methods**: Analyzing the prevalence of different attack types.
- **Sectoral Impact**: Assessing which industry sectors are most targeted and the associated impacts.
- **Financial Implications**: Evaluating the economic consequences of cyber attacks.

## Key Findings

- **Peak Incident Year**: The highest number of cybersecurity incidents occurred in 2017.
- **Most Affected Country**: The United Kingdom experienced the highest financial losses, exceeding $16 billion.
- **Predominant Attack Type**: Phishing was the most common attack method, particularly prevalent in 2017.
- **Targeted Sectors**: The IT and banking sectors were the most frequently targeted, with DDoS attacks common in IT and phishing in banking.
- **Post-2020 Stability**: After 2020, the frequency and impact of cyber attacks have remained relatively stable.

## Technologies:
